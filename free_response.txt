Part 1: Greedy Search and Ancestral Sampling

Q2: Free response: What looks good and bad about the outputs from greedy search, and why? Explicitly tie your explanation to how greedy search works.
A: 
What Looks Good
The outputs start grammatically correct and contextually relevant because greedy search selects the most probable next token, which initially produces sensible continuations.
What Looks Bad
Severe repetition dominates almost every example (e.g., "He was a high school dropout" repeated 5 times, "I was so happy to be back in the band" repeated 4 times). This happens because greedy search deterministically selects the highest probability token at each step with no randomness to escape repetitive patterns—once stuck in a loop, it cannot explore alternative paths, making it trapped in a local maximum where continuing the repetition remains most probable.

Q4:Discuss how the outputs from ancestral sampling differ from those obtained from greedy search. Explicitly tie your explanation to how ancestral sampling works in contrast to greedy search.
A:

Part 2: Top-k and Top-p Decoding

Q2:Discuss how the outputs from top-k decoding differ from those obtained from greedy search and ancestral sampling. Explicitly tie your explanation to how top-k decoding works in contrast to greedy search and ancestral sampling. Is top-k decoding ever the same as greedy search?
A:

Q4:Discuss how the outputs from top-p decoding differ from those obtained from the previous methods. Explicitly tie your explanation to how top-p decoding works in contrast to the other methods, particularly top-k.
